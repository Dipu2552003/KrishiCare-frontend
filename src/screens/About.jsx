                In addition to recommending the best crops to plant, KrishiCare
                offers forecasts for crop prices, helping farmers plan their
                planting and harvesting schedules effectively. The platform also
                includes tools for monitoring crop health and progress, allowing
                farmers to make necessary adjustments throughout the growing
                season. By equipping farmers with these insights, KrishiCare
                ensures they are well-informed and capable of managing their
                farming operations independently. KrishiCare goes beyond crop
                management by offering a complete solution that supports farmers
                from cultivation to sale. Farmers can sell their produce through
                the platform, while inspectors use advanced deep learning
                technology to assess crop quality and detect diseases through
                image analysis. Once the crops pass inspection, traders can
                purchase them directly. This streamlined process enables farmers
                to control their operations and income, ensuring a more
                efficient and profitable farming experience.
